			<li>
				Repository: a folder in which all files and their
				 version histories are stored.
			</li>
			<li>
				Commit: a saved record of a change made to a file
				within the repo.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fork: a new repository that shares code and visibility 
				settings with the original “upstream” repository.
			</li>
			<li>
				Push: updates the remote repository with any commits
				made locally to a branch.
			</li>
			<li>
				Pull Requests: the way to ask for changes made 
				to a branch to be merged into another branch that 
				also allows for multiple users to see, discuss and
				review work being done.
			</li>
			<li>
				Workflows: a configurable automated process that will
				run one or more jobs.
			</li>

				progress on a project board from beginning to end
				of a specific project.

				that any HTML formatting disappears.

				revision, author and time.
