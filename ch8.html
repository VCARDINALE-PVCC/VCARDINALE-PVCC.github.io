    <h2>How a text file can be hidden in a steganographic image:</h2>
    <p>
        A text file can be hidden in a steganographic image by manipulating the least significant bit of each pixel to store the text data.
        This can be done by replacing the least significant bit of the color values in the image with the binary digits of the text file.
        By doing this, the image will still appear unchanged to the human eye, but the hidden text can be extracted using steganography tools.

    <h2>Six ways to protect yourself from most cyber attacks:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Keep your operating system and software up to date with the latest security patches and updates.</li>
        <li>Use strong and unique passwords for all your online accounts, and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.</li>
        <li>Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown or suspicious sources, and use anti-virus and anti-malware software to protect your devices.</li>
        <li>Use a virtual private network (VPN) when accessing the internet on public Wi-Fi networks or when traveling to protect your online activities from prying eyes.</li>
        <li>Back up your important data regularly to protect against data loss from cyber attacks or other disasters.</li>
        <li>Educate yourself about common cyber threats and how to protect against them, and practice good cyber hygiene habits such as avoiding oversharing personal information online.</li>

    <h2> <a href="https://highschool.spsd.org/crypt/index.html">Play the Crypt Games:</a></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Easy ciphers game:</li>
        <p>PIG PEN: a substitution cipher between symbols and letters very easy and intuitive - I would use to play with this cipher as a young child.</p>
        <li>Normal ciphers game:</li>
        <p>Rail Fence: a cipher that reveals the answer upon reading the correct way (in a snake-like motion) also very intuitive - would be very easy to teach young children.</p>
        <li>Hard ciphers game:</li>
        <p>VIGENERE: uses a grid and key phrase in combination to create coordinates to the correct letters very annoying - did not provide an example on page and instructions were not the clearest.</p>
    </ol>

    <h2>Your opinion:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What do you think of Christine McCarthy and her cipher games project?</li>
        <p>Christine McCarthy's cipher games project is a website that provides interactive puzzles and challenges related to cryptography, aimed at engaging people and increasing their interest in the field. It is a creative and educational initiative that can help people learn about cryptography in a fun and engaging way at entry level.</p>
        <li>Would you recommend this site to others who might be interested in cryptography?</li>
        <p>It could be a helpful tool for learning and practicing cryptography skills. However, it is definitely at an entry-level on the subject.</p>
        <li>What do you think of Christine’s code?</li>
        <p>It is very simple yet gets the job done.</p>
