    <h2>Briefly describe the five layers of TCP/IP (the Internet protocol hierarchy):</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Physical layer:</strong> This layer defines the physical aspects of data transmission, such as the type of cables, connectors, and signal voltages used to transmit data over a network.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data link layer:</strong> This layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data between two devices on the same network. It includes protocols such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Network layer:</strong> This layer handles the routing of data between different networks. It includes protocols such as IP (Internet Protocol) and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Transport layer:</strong> This layer is responsible for the reliable delivery of data between applications running on different devices. It includes protocols such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Application layer:</strong> This layer provides the interface between the network and the applications running on the devices. It includes protocols such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>List and briefly describe at least 3 network services and benefits:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Email Service:</strong> Email service is a network service that enables users to send and receive electronic messages over a network. Email is a fast and reliable way to communicate with others, regardless of their location or time zone. It allows for easy sharing of files and attachments, and it is accessible from multiple devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>File Sharing Service:</strong> File sharing service is a network service that allows users to share files with others over a network. This service is commonly used for collaborative work, allowing multiple users to access and edit the same document at the same time. It is also useful for sharing large files, such as videos or high-resolution images, that would be difficult to share via email.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Remote Access Service:</strong> Remote access service is a network service that enables users to access a network or computer from a remote location. This service is useful for telecommuting, allowing employees to work from home or on the go. It also provides IT professionals with remote access to servers and other network resources, allowing for quick and efficient troubleshooting and maintenance.
