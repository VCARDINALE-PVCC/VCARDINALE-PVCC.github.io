    <h1>Chapter 9: Introduction to High Level Languages</h1>

    <h3>List four disadvantages of using assembly language:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Complexity: Assembly language is a low-level language that requires a deep understanding of computer architecture and hardware. This makes it more difficult to learn and use than higher-level programming languages.</li>
        <li>Debugging: Debugging code written in assembly language can be challenging because errors in the code can be difficult to locate and fix. This is because assembly language provides very little abstraction over the hardware, which means that even minor errors can have significant consequences.</li>
        <li>Portability: Assembly language is highly dependent on the specific hardware it is written for. Code written in assembly language for one processor or computer architecture will not necessarily work on another processor or architecture without significant modifications. This makes it less portable than higher-level programming languages.</li>
        <li>Maintenance: Because assembly language is so low-level, programs written in assembly language tend to be more difficult to maintain than programs written in higher-level programming languages. This is because changes to the hardware or software environment may require significant modifications to the code, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>List of Expectations for High-Level Programming Languages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Abstraction: High-level programming languages provide a high degree of abstraction, which means that programmers can focus on solving problems without needing to understand the low-level details of the hardware or computer architecture.</li>
        <li>Productivity: High-level programming languages allow programmers to write code more quickly and efficiently than in low-level languages like assembly language. This is because high-level languages provide more built-in functionality and require less code to perform the same tasks.</li>
        <li>Portability: Programs written in high-level programming languages are generally more portable than programs written in low-level languages. This is because high-level languages provide more abstraction over the hardware, making it easier to write code that can run on different architectures or platforms.</li>
        <li>Readability and maintainability: High-level programming languages are designed to be more readable and maintainable than low-level languages. This is because high-level languages provide more expressive syntax and built-in features, making it easier to write code that is easy to understand and modify over time.</li>

    <h1>Chapter 10: Tower of Babel: Programming Languages</h1>
    <h3>Questions & Answers:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Q: Why does the textbook refer to "the Tower of Babel" regarding computer languages?</p>
            <p>A: The term "Tower of Babel" is used in the textbook to refer to the proliferation of computer languages and the resulting difficulty of communication between programs written in different languages, similar to the biblical story in which people spoke different languages and could not understand each other.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: Why isn't there just one computer programming language?</p>
            <p>A: There isn't just one computer programming language because different programming languages are designed for different purposes and have different strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, as technology evolves and new needs arise, new programming languages are developed to meet those needs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: Why didn't FORTRAN use the less than (<) symbol when comparing two numbers?</p>
            <p>A: FORTRAN did not use the less than symbol for comparing two numbers because it was designed to work with early IBM computers that used punched cards for input. The less than symbol was not included on the standard set of punched cards, so FORTRAN used other symbols to represent less than (<) and greater than (>) comparisons.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: What was COBOL designed for?</p>
            <p>A: COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) was designed for business applications such as accounting, payroll, and inventory management. It was intended to be easily readable and written by non-technical business users.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: What was the language, C, designed for?</p>
            <p>A: C was originally designed as a systems programming language for the development of the UNIX operating system. It is known for its efficiency, flexibility, and low-level control over computer hardware.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: What is the difference between C and C++?</p>
            <p>A: C++ is an extension of the C programming language that adds support for object-oriented programming (OOP) features such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. C++ also includes additional features such as templates and exception handling that are not part of the C language.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: Who or what is the language, Ada, named for and why?</p>
            <p>A: Ada is named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician who is considered to be the first computer programmer for her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. The language was named in her honor to recognize her contribution to the field of computing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: What is a Java "applet"?</p>
            <p>A: A Java applet is a small program written in the Java programming language that can be embedded within a web page to provide interactive content. Applets are executed within a web browser's Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can be used to create animations, games, and other interactive applications.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: How much does Python cost to download, install, and use?</p>
            <p>A: Python is a free and open-source programming language, so it can be downloaded, installed, and used for free.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: What is Microsoft.NET?</p>
            <p>A: Microsoft.NET is a software framework developed by Microsoft that supports the development and execution of applications for Windows, as well as other platforms such as web applications, mobile devices, and gaming consoles. It includes a set of programming languages, runtime environments, and development tools.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: What is SQL and what is it used for?</p>
            <p>A: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is used to create and modify database structures, as well as insert, update, and retrieve data from databases.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: What is Go (or golang) and what is it used for?</p>
            <p>A: Go, also known as Golang, is a programming language developed by Google in 2007. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to read and write, with a focus on concurrency and scalability. Go is often used for building network servers, web applications, and command-line tools.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Q: What is Swift and what is it used for?</p>
            <p>A: Swift is a programming language developed by Apple in 2014. It is used for developing applications for Apple's platforms, including iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Swift is designed to be easy to learn, with a simple syntax and a focus on safety and performance. It is often used for building mobile apps, desktop applications, and server-side applications.</p>
