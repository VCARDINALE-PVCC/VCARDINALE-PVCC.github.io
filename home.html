            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>In 1962, a group of parents in New Hyde Park, New York, challenged the constitutionality of a voluntary, nondenominational prayer that was recited each day in their children's public school. The prayer was written by the New York State Board of Regents and read as follows: "Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our country."</p>

            <h3>The Supreme Court's Decision</h3>
            <p>The case was brought before the Supreme Court, which held that the prayer was indeed unconstitutional. In a 6-1 decision, the Court ruled that the recitation of the prayer in public schools violated the Establishment Clause because it constituted a government endorsement of religion. The Court noted that the Establishment Clause "has erected a wall between church and state" and that the government must remain neutral with respect to religion.</p>

            <h3>Implications of the Decision</h3>
            <p>The Engel decision established the principle that the government may not endorse or promote any particular religion, and that it must remain neutral with respect to religion. This principle has been applied in a wide range of contexts, from public schools to government-funded programs and facilities.</p>

            <h3>Impact on Prayer in Public Schools</h3>
            <p>Prior to Engel, it was common for public schools to include a prayer or a Bible reading as part of their daily routine. After the decision, however, such practices were deemed unconstitutional, and public schools were required to refrain from endorsing or promoting any particular religion.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Controversy</h3>
            <p>The Engel decision was not without controversy, however. Many religious leaders and conservative politicians criticized the decision as an attack on religion and a violation of the religious freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment. They argued that the decision amounted to an endorsement of atheism or secularism, and that it ignored the religious beliefs of the majority of Americans.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The Engel v. Vitale case was a pivotal moment in the history of the separation of church and state in the United States. It established the principle that the government must remain neutral with respect to religion and may not endorse or promote any particular religion. The decision had far-reaching implications for the role of religion in public life, and it remains an important landmark in the ongoing debate over the relationship between religion and the state. While the decision has not been without controversy, it has helped to ensure that the government respects the religious freedoms of all Americans, regardless of their beliefs or affiliations.</p>
