    <h1>Chapter 12: Models of Computation</h1>
    <h2>1. What is the purpose of a model?</h2>
    <p>The purpose of a model is to represent, simulate, or predict a real-world system, phenomenon, or process. Models can be used to better understand complex systems, make predictions, and test theories.</p>

    <h2>2. List four phenomena of a model:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Abstraction: A model is a simplified representation of a complex system, phenomenon, or process. It involves reducing the number of variables, details, or interactions to focus on the most important aspects of the system.</li>
        <li>Generalization: A model should be able to capture the essential features of the real-world system and be applicable to a wide range of scenarios, not just specific cases.</li>
        <li>Approximation: A model is an approximation of reality and may not capture all the details of the system. Therefore, models should be evaluated based on their accuracy, reliability, and limitations.</li>
        <li>Prediction: Models can be used to make predictions about future outcomes or behaviors of the system based on current knowledge and assumptions. However, the accuracy of these predictions depends on the quality of the model and the quality of the data used to parameterize the model.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. List four things a computing agent should be able to do:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Receive input: A computing agent should be able to receive input from the user or from other sources such as sensors, databases, or networks.</li>
        <li>Process data: A computing agent should be able to process and manipulate data according to the instructions provided in the program or algorithm.</li>
        <li>Produce output: A computing agent should be able to produce output in the form of text, graphics, sound, or other forms based on the input and processing.</li>
        <li>Store and retrieve data: A computing agent should be able to store data in memory or on disk and retrieve it as needed. This could include managing databases, files, or other data structures.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. List four characteristics of an algorithm:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Well-defined: An algorithm must be well-defined, which means it must be clear, unambiguous, and complete. Each step of the algorithm should be precisely defined and capable of being executed.</li>
        <li>Finite: An algorithm must be finite, which means it must terminate after a finite number of steps. This is important because an algorithm that never terminates is useless.</li>
        <li>Input: An algorithm must have zero or more inputs. The inputs are the data that the algorithm processes to produce output.</li>
        <li>Output: An algorithm must have at least one output. The output is the result of the algorithm's computation and can be in various forms, such as a number, a string, a list, or a graphic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. What is the "halting problem" with regards to an uncomputable problem?</h2>
    <p>The halting problem is the problem of determining whether an algorithm will halt or run forever on a given input. It is uncomputable, meaning that there is no general algorithm that can solve it for all possible inputs. This shows that there are limits to what can be computed.</p>
